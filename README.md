# Simulation of Current in LED device

%## Introduction
Simulation of the evolution of electric current inside a LED device in its ON state.
I solve a 1D Schroedingher equation that evolves electron system (around 50 electrons). Electrons undergoes interaction with an external particle, a photon.
This interaction, called scattering, is implemented in an innovative way which modifies teh total energy of teh particle, and not only its kinetic energy, differently to what is normally done.

This software, in an alternative form, was used for the publication of the the peer-reviewed published paper:
Title: Scattering in Terms of Bohmian Conditional Wave Functions for Scenarios with Non-Commuting Energy and Momentum Operators
